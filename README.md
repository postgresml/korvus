## ü¶Ö What is Korvus?

Korvus is an all-in-one, open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline built for Postgres. It combines LLMs, vector memory, embedding generation, reranking, summarization and custom models into a single query, maximizing performance and simplifying your search architecture.

![korvus-demo](https://github.com/postgresml/korvus/assets/19626586/9ee9d695-7630-4da7-ab2a-386e20ae4a68)

## üî† Languages
Korvus provides SDK support for multiple programming languages, allowing you to integrate it seamlessly into your existing tech stack:

- Python: [PyPI Package](https://pypi.org/project/korvus/)
- JavaScript: [npm Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/korvus)
- Rust: [Crates.io Package](https://crates.io/crates/korvus)
- C: [Build from source](https://postgresml.org/docs/api/client-sdk/)

## üèÜ Why Korvus?

Korvus stands out by harnessing the full power of Postgres for RAG operations:

1. **Postgres-Native RAG**: Korvus leverages Postgres' robust capabilities, allowing you to perform complex RAG operations directly within your database. This approach eliminates the need for external services and API calls, significantly reducing latency and complexity many times over.

2. **Single Query Efficiency**: With Korvus, your entire RAG pipeline - from embedding generation to text generation - is executed in a single SQL query. This "one query to rule them all" approach simplifies your architecture and boosts performance.

3. **Scalability and Performance**: By building on Postgres, Korvus inherits its excellent scalability and performance characteristics. As your data grows, Korvus grows with it, maintaining high performance even with large datasets.

## ‚ö° Key Features

- **Simplified Architecture**: Replace complex service oriented architectures with a single, powerful query.
- **High Performance**: Eliminates API calls and data movement for faster processing and greater reliability.
- **Open Source**: Improve your developer experience with open source software and models that run locally in Docker too.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Use Korvus with Python, JavaScript and Rust. Open an issue to vote for other language support.
- **Unified Pipeline**: Combine embedding generation, vector search, reranking, and text generation in one query.
- **Postgres-Powered**: Under the hood, Korvus operations are powered by efficient SQL queries on a time-tested database platform.

## üß© System Architecture

Korvus utilizes PostgresML's pgml extension and the pgvector extension to compress the entire RAG pipeline inside of Postgres.

## üöÄ Get Started

### üìã Prerequisites

To use Korvus, you need a Postgres database with pgml and pgvector installed. You have two options:

1. **Self-hosted**: Set up your own database with pgml and pgvector.
   - For instructions, see our [self-hosting guide](https://postgresml.org/docs/open-source/pgml/developers/quick-start-with-docker).

2. **Hosted Service**: Use our managed Postgres service with pgml and pgvector pre-installed.
   - [Sign up for PostgresML Cloud](https://postgresml.org/signup).

### üèÅ Quick Start

1. Install Korvus:

```bash
pip install korvus
```

2. Set the `KORVUS_DATABASE_URL` env variable:

```bash
export KORVUS_DATABASE_URL="{YOUR DATABASE CONNECTION STRING}"
```

3. Initialize a Collection and Pipeline:

```python
from korvus import Collection, Pipeline
import asyncio

collection = Collection("korvus-demo-v0")
pipeline = Pipeline(
    "v1",
    {
        "text": {
            "splitter": {"model": "recursive_character"},
            "semantic_search": {"model": "Alibaba-NLP/gte-base-en-v1.5"},
        }
    },
)

async def add_pipeline():
    await collection.add_pipeline(pipeline)

asyncio.run(add_pipeline())
```

4. Insert documents:
```python
async def upsert_documents():
    documents = [
        {"id": "1", "text": "Korvus is incredibly fast and easy to use."},
        {"id": "2", "text": "Tomatoes are incredible on burgers."},
    ]
    await collection.upsert_documents(documents)

asyncio.run(upsert_documents())
```

5. Perform RAG
```python
async def rag():
    query = "Is Korvus fast?"
    print(f"Querying for response to: {query}")
    results = await collection.rag(
        {
            "CONTEXT": {
                "vector_search": {
                    "query": {
                        "fields": {"text": {"query": query}},
                    },
                    "document": {"keys": ["id"]},
                    "limit": 1,
                },
                "aggregate": {"join": "\n"},
            },
            "chat": {
                "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
                "messages": [
                    {
                        "role": "system",
                        "content": "You are a friendly and helpful chatbot",
                    },
                    {
                        "role": "user",
                        "content": f"Given the context\n:{{CONTEXT}}\nAnswer the question: {query}",
                    },
                ],
                "max_tokens": 100,
            },
        },
        pipeline,
    )
    print(results)

asyncio.run(rag())
```

## üîç The Power of SQL

While Korvus provides a high-level interface in multiple programming languages, its core operations are built on optimized SQL queries. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Transparency**: Advanced users can inspect and understand the underlying queries.
- **Customizability**: Extend Korvus's capabilities by modifying or adding to its SQL operations.
- **Performance**: Benefit from PostgreSQL's advanced query optimization capabilities.

Don't worry if you're not a SQL expert - Korvus's intuitive API abstracts away the complexity while still allowing you to harness the full power of SQL-based operations.
